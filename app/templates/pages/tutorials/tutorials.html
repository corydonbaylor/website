            <p>
                Well start here. In this series of tutorials, we will cover how to first build a
                static website using just HTML and CSS. Then we will add in bootstrap,
                which is a CSS framework. Then we will cover how to add in a backend using flask.
                This will make our website signficantly easier to maintain and update.
                Finally, we will go over how to host your website on a raspberry pi, so
                that other people can access your website!

                I am going to take you on a Shiny Odyssey. We will start with a basic app and add complexity as we go.
                By the end of it, you will learn how the server and UI works, what packages to use, and how to host an
                app on a server.

            <p>
                Despite R and the tidyverse being easy, expressive, and remarkably legible, a lot of people prefer to use Python. I have not founda  great resource
                for people who are familiar with R to familiarize themselves with python. So I am writing one now.
