<p>Most of what we have covered thus far relates to the server portion of the app and very little attention has been
    paid to the UI. It&#39;s time to remedy that. In this section, we will cover the wonderful
    <code>shinydashboard</code> package and take a deeper dive into how shiny builds UI elements to start with.
</p>
<h3>How Shiny Builds a UI</h3>
<p>Right now, we have a pretty simple app. Let&#39;s take a look under the hood. To do this, open the app in a web
    browser (use chrome), and right click and click inspect. </p>
<p>You should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code class='language-html' lang='html'>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html class&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;container-fluid&quot;&gt;
		::before
		&lt;h3&gt;The Titanic!&lt;/h3&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;form-group shiny-input-container&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;div id=&quot;plot&quot; class=&quot;shiny-plot-output shiny-bound-output&quot; style=&quot;width: 100% ; height: 400px&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
		::after
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div id=&quot;shiny-disconnected-overlay&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I am not going to explain each part, and I am going to assume you have some basic understanding of what HTML is (its
    the building blocks of a webpage). However, I think its worth demystifying what shiny is doing here. Remember the UI
    portion of our script looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class='language-r' lang='r'>ui &lt;- fluidPage(
    h3(&quot;The Titanic!&quot;),
    selectInput(inputId = &quot;class&quot;, label = &quot;Passengar Class&quot;, choices = c(&quot;1st&quot;, &quot;2nd&quot;, &quot;3rd&quot;, &quot;Crew&quot;)),
    plotOutput(&quot;plot&quot;)
)
</code></pre>
<p>Under the hood, shiny takes functions like <code>h3()</code> and translates them into HTML tags like
    <code>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;</code>. Some functions are named after different HTML tags, and its somewhat obvious how
    they will translate into HTML. Others are less clear. Let&#39;s cover each part of the UI and how it translates into
    HTML.
</p>
<figure>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>R Code</th>
                <th>HTML</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><code>fluidPage()</code></td>
                <td><code>&lt;div class=&quot;container-fluid&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>h3()</code></td>
                <td><code>&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>selectInput()</code></td>
                <td><code>&lt;div class=&quot;form-group shiny-input-container&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>plotOutput()</code></td>
                <td><code>&lt;div id=&quot;plot&quot; class=&quot;shiny-plot-output shiny-bound-output&quot; style=&quot;width: 100% ; height: 400px&quot;&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</code>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</figure>
<p>Everything we create in the UI is simply a wrapper for HTML tags (and their accompanying CSS classes). </p>
<h3>Simple Wrappers in <code>htmltools</code></h3>
<p>I said earlier that sometimes it&#39;s obvious how shiny code will translate into HTML. One of shiny&#39;s
    dependencies is <code>htmltools</code> and within that package are a series of convenience functions used to create
    common HTML tags. </p>
<p>There are dedicated functions for the more common tags like <code>p()</code>, <code>div()</code>, and
    <code>span()</code>. But every valid HTML tag can be accessed using <code>tags$</code> (for example you can access
    the title tag using <code>tags$title()</code>, which will of course create
    <code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code>).
</p>
<p>More importantly, each tag has two important arguments: class and id. This allows you to specify the class and id for
    each tag you create. </p>
<p>For example, writing:</p>
<pre><code>div(class = &quot;my-class&quot;, id = &quot;id1&quot;, &quot;This is my Div&quot;) 
</code></pre>
<p>will create: </p>
<pre><code>&lt;div class = &quot;my-class&quot; id = &quot;id1&quot;&gt; This is my Div &lt;/div&gt;. 
</code></pre>
<p>This becomes super powerful when you import your own css file!</p>
<h3>Finally <code>shinydashboard</code></h3>
<p>Ok, so no we understand the UI a little better. Let&#39;s add shinydashboard to our app. Looking at their <a
        href='https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/index.html'>tutorial</a>, a shiny dashboard app will consist of
    three main pieces: the header, the sidebar, and the body.</p>
<pre><code>## ui.R ##
library(shinydashboard)

dashboardPage(
  dashboardHeader(),
  dashboardSidebar(),
  dashboardBody()
)
</code></pre>
<p> The header will contain different elements that would typically go into the head of a webpage, like links to CSS and
    javascript. The sidebar will contain different tabs in our dashboard, and the body contains the main content of the
    app. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s add this to our app.</p>
<pre><code>library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
library(shinydashboard)

# a function to create the UI
ui &lt;- dashboardPage(
        dashboardHeader(),
        dashboardSidebar(),
        dashboardBody(
            h3(&quot;The Titanic!&quot;),
            selectInput(inputId = &quot;class&quot;, label = &quot;Passengar Class&quot;, 
                        choices = c(&quot;1st&quot;, &quot;2nd&quot;, &quot;3rd&quot;, &quot;Crew&quot;)),
            plotOutput(&quot;plot&quot;)
        )
)
</code></pre>
<p>Essentially, all we have done at this point is replaced <code>fluidPage()</code> with <code>dashboardPage()</code>
    and placed all our content in <code>dashboardBody()</code>.</p>
<p>At this point our app will look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/tutorials/shiny/dashboard/dashboard01.png')}}" class="img-center"></p>

<h3>Adding Multiple Tabs</h3>
<p><code>shinydashboard</code> is helpful for organizing large applications where there are a ton of different tabs and
    subtabs. Right now we just have one plot and one select input. If this was going to be our whole app, we
    wouldn&#39;t want to use shiny dashboard. But let&#39;s say that we wanted to have a second tab that was about
    survival rates and gender. </p>
<p>First we are going to update the sidebar to have two tabs:</p>
<pre><code>  dashboardSidebar(
    sidebarMenu(
      menuItem(&quot;Passenger Class&quot;, tabName = &quot;class&quot;, icon = icon(&quot;dashboard&quot;)),
      menuItem(&quot;Gender&quot;, tabName = &quot;gender&quot;, icon = icon(&quot;th&quot;))
    )
  )
</code></pre>
<p> And then we are going to add the tabs to the dashboard body:</p>
<pre><code>  
dashboardBody(
    tabItems(
    	# class tab
      tabItem(tabName = &quot;class&quot;,
		# CONTENT GOES HERE
      ), 
			# gender tab
      tabItem(tabName = &quot;gender&quot;,
        # CONTENT GOES HERE
      )       
    ) 
  )
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, let&#39;s change the title of the app to &quot;The Titanic&quot;</p>
<pre><code>dashboardHeader(	
    title = &quot;The Titanic&quot;
    )
</code></pre>
<p>All together, our UI will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class='language-r' lang='r'># a function to create the UI
ui <- dashboardPage(
    dashboardHeader(
        title = "The Titanic"
    ),
    dashboardSidebar(
            sidebarMenu(
                menuItem("Passenger Class", tabName = "class", icon = icon("dashboard")),
                menuItem("Gender", tabName = "gender", icon = icon("th"))
            )
        ),
        dashboardBody(
            tabItems(
                # class tab
                tabItem(tabName = "class",
                        h3("The Titanic!"),
                        selectInput(inputId = "class", label = "Passengar Class", 
                                    choices = c("1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew")),
                        plotOutput("plot")
                        ), 
                # gender tab
                tabItem(tabName = "gender",
                        # CONTENT GOES HERE
                )       
            ) 
        )
)
</code></pre>
<h3>Including You Own CSS</h3>
<p>At its roots, both the UI in shiny and the UI in shiny dashboard are wrappers for bootstrap components. The benefit
    of using out of the box components is that it takes significantly less time to build your dashboard, but the
    downside is that all shiny dashboards have the same feel to them. </p>
<p>Luckily, we are not constrained by bootstrap. We can write our own CSS file and include it in app.</p>
<p>Here is the thing. You might be thinking, &quot;oh great, now I need to learn CSS&quot;. Don&#39;t worry, you really
    don&#39;t. But if you want your dashboards to stand out, this is how you do it.</p>
<p>First we are going to create a new folder in the parent directory of our app called &quot;www&quot;, and in that
    folder, next you are going to create a CSS file. This you can name whatever you would like. </p>
<p>At this point your project directory should look like this:</p>
<pre>
    <code>|---project (whatever folder your project is in)		
        |---app.R		
        |---www		
        |------custom.css
</code></pre>
<p> Next you are going to open up custom.css and add whatever CSS you would like. Next we are going to tell shiny to
    include our css. Add the following to the <code>dashboardBody()</code> section of your app:</p>
<pre><code>dashboardBody(
    includeCSS("www/styling.css"),
tabItems(....</code></pre>
<p>We are going to create a class called &quot;boxy&quot; that creates a turquoise box. Here is our CSS class:</p>
<pre><code>.boxy {
  width: 100%;
  background-color: darkcyan;
  margin: 5px;
  padding: 2px;
  color:white;
  text-align: center;
}
</code></pre>
<p> Lets add a div with this class to the &quot;gender tab&quot;:</p>
<pre><code>                # gender tab
tabItem(tabName = &quot;gender&quot;,
        div(class = &quot;boxy&quot;, &quot;Our custom div&quot;)
) 
</code></pre>
<p>Now the gender tab will contain a custom styled div:</p>
<p><img src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/tutorials/shiny/dashboard/dashboard02.png')}}" class="img-center"></p>

<h3>Rows and Columns</h3>
<p>We&#39;ve covered how to organize our content into different tabs, but we also need to cover how to organize content
    within the tabs. Shiny dashboard uses the <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/'>Bootstrap grid
        system</a> to organize content. </p>
<p>In a grid system, items are organized by row and columns. Each row has a grid width of 12, meaning that a row can be
    divided into 12 columns of even width. When you place an item in the grid, you specify how many of the 12 columns
    that item will take. </p>
<p>So if you wanted two evenly spaced items on the same row, you would set both items to have a width of 6. And if you
    wanted one to be slightly larger than the other you would set one item to be 7 and the other to be 5. </p>
<p>It might be easier to show than to explain. </p>
<p>Shinydashboard comes with a lot of components that our out of scope to explain here. One of them is called box.
    &quot;Box&quot; is just a div tag styled to look like a fancy box. I am going to make a couple rows of boxes to show
    how the grid works.</p>
<p>Within the &quot;gender&quot; tab add:</p>
<pre><code>tabItem(tabName = "gender",
    fluidRow(
        column(width = 4, div(class = "boxy", "1/3" )),
        column(width = 4, div(class = "boxy", "1/3")),
        column(width = 4, div(class = "boxy", "1/3"))
    ),
    fluidRow(
        column(width = 6, div(class = "boxy", "1/2" )),
        column(width = 6, div(class = "boxy", "1/2"))
    ),
    fluidRow(
        column(width = 3, div(class = "boxy", "3/12" )),
        column(width = 9, div(class = "boxy", "9/12"))
    )  
)       
</code></pre>
<p>The page should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/tutorials/shiny/dashboard/dashboard03.gif')}}" class="img-center"></p>

<p>See what happens when I resizing the page. The boxes stretch and shrink to fit the width of the screen. If you make
    the screen small enough, the boxes will fill the page (and the sidebar will disappear as well). This is called
    responsive web design. The size of the elements on the page will change in response to how the user sizes the
    screen.</p>
<p>There is a lot more to shinydashboard besides what I have covered here, and I would highly recommend reading through
    their tutorial on how to use all the features, but what we have covered here will give you more than enough to learn
    how to use this package.</p>
