We could see the lights of ships gliding across the dark horizon of the Mediterranean sea. It was our first night on shore in nearly a month, and we were eager to exceed the two drink maximum imposed on us while at sea. </p>
    <p>We had spent the past three week crossing the Atlantic on a cruise ship from the 1970&#39;s that had been outfitted into a sort of floating college. And we were disoriented--by the constant rocking of the ship, by the endless horizon of water that had greeted us for nearly a month, and by our shifting internal clocks.  On the voyage over, almost every night, we lost an hour.  Time had begun to feel abstract and artificial. Bendable, almost breakable. </p>
    <p>That first night, I was out with Daniel Pelaez, a work study colleague of mine from the ship&#39;s onboard library. I had hoped to meet up with Marimar Escoto, a girl from my conversational Spanish class, but unfortunately, due to the somewhat frantic nature of arranging plans without cell phones, it did not happen. </p>
    <p>No one had brought our phones with them because (1) in 2012, American phone carriers did not provide inexpensive service in Europe, and (2) we were convinced that we would being pick pocketed if we did.</p>
    <p>We would have been the classic marks--inebriated college students with little to no common sense but stuffed with disposable cash supplied by loving yet faraway parents. </p>
    <p>We would traipse up and down Las Ramblas, which is a sort of nice pedestrian mall where tourists buy Messi bobbleheads and Barcelona futbol scarfs, looking for cheap Sangria and corner stores where we could buy beer. I don&#39;t remember if we found any. It was a time in my life when a night of merriment wouldn&#39;t cost a three day hangover.  </p>
    The air felt crisp. I dug my foot into the sand, feeling the sand slip between my toes. I finished my can, squeezed it, and felt the aluminum crush. We got up and headed into the city, the first of eight on our Semester at Sea.

    <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>here is an element of the surreal in Rome. Much of what you see, you have seen a thousand times before in pictures and movies, or read about in history class. And finally, you arrive in Rome and make your way through the city, led by enthusiastic tour guides, brimming with trivia, and you stand before something as old and famous as the Coliseum, something you&#39;ve dreamt of seeing since your childhood, and now you are finally here, and you take out your phone and snap a picture. And that&#39;s it. </p>
    <p>It all can be a little anticlimactic in the end. </p>
    <p>The Italians tend to dress nice. Pants and long sleeve button downs, even in the summer. So to blend in, I was under the impression that I too should were pants and a button down. As with any foreigner whose summer culture revolves around the presence of an air conditioner, I was left amazed by how well-kept and sweat-free the locals were, as they briskly walked down the cobble stone streets and sipped cappuccino in unventaled cafes. </p>
    <p>I was out on a tour that day with Naomi Newman, a friend of mine that I had met through Daniel. She had a dry, deeply sarcastic sense of humor, and curly blonde hair. At each stop of the tour, we would pose together in front of ancient roman ruins, attempting to look as uninterested as possible--something close to Grant Wood&#39;s American Gothic. </p>
    <p>As we entered the Coliseum, The tour guide instructed us to look at the deep holes borne into the travertine and tufa limestone facade. The Romans did not use mortar to hold the thing together but rather long iron clamps. In the Middle Ages, these iron clamps were pilfered to make weapons and cookware, leaving the aforementioned holes. </p>
    <p>I shook my head at the thought that the structural integrity of something as grand as the Coliseum was risked for something so transitory as a kettle. </p>
    <p>I would later learn that much of the marble adorning the Vatican had been taken directly from the Coliseum, as it was the closet &quot;marble quarry&quot; near by. The greatest architectural work of the Middle Ages owed its very bones to the greatest architectural work of the Classical Ages. Ancient Rome had never been destroyed; it was simply reduced, reused or recycled.    </p>

    <p><span class="firstcharacter">F</span>rom my train window, Mount Vesuvius flickered in and out of view. The (still active) volcano is the larger of two mountainous humps that dominate the Neapolitan seaside. It&#39;s a forty minute train ride from Naples to Pompeii, and as you snake along the coast, your view of the volcano rotates. More than two million people inhabit the area surrounding Vesuvius, much of them in Naples, where our ship was docked. </p>
    <p>Nearly 2,000 years prior, two aristocratic Roman statesmen, both named Pliny, would look across that same bay to find a thick column of smoke arising from Vesuvius. A letter from Pliny the Younger, which I quote throughout, would be the only surviving contemporaneous account of the eruption and its aftermath. </p>
    <p>His uncle, Pliny the Elder, would lead the rescue effort from Misenum, a town an hour northeast of modern day Naples. He sailed directly into the disaster, hoping to rescue survivors.</p>
    <blockquote><p>Ashes were already falling, hotter and thicker as the ships drew near, followed by bits of pumice and blackened stones, charred and cracked by the flames: then suddenly they were in shallow water, and the shore was blocked by the debris from the mountain.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Unable to dock in Pompeii, he would reroute and land in Stabiae, a port nine miles south. Suddenly, the bay turned violent and dangerous, making a retreat by sea infeasible. Finding himself stuck, the Elder retired to rest in a villa, but the thick precipitation of ash and pumice stone continued, and by the time he awoke:</p>
    <blockquote><p>The courtyard giving access to his room was full of ashes mixed with pumice stones, so that its level had risen, and if he had stayed in the room any longer he would never have got out. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>His crew would attempt an escape by traveling by foot along the coastline, covering their heads with pillows to soften the blows from the pumice, but the Elder Pliny would remain behind, as his breathing had grown heavy amidst the choking ash.</p>
    <p>I held a bit of chalky pumice while walking the nearly perfectly preserved streets of Pompeii. I ducked into the homes and shops of Romans. Saw the frescos and mosaics, and walked in the center of the Amphitheater of Pompeii. </p>
    <p>The town did not feel like a disaster site until you see the casts. The thick layers of ash and pumice dumped upon Pompeii eventually hardened, leaving bubbles of air as the corpses decomposed over time. Archeologists would pump plaster into these pockets of air to create casts in the impressions. </p>
    <p>In a room filled with recovered ancient vases sat one of these casts. He was sitting upright, his knees pressed up tightly to his chest, his face buried in his hands, the very outline of despair. </p>
    <p>Pliny, across the bay, in relative safety described the scene as ash fell heavy enough to blot out the sun.</p>
    <blockquote><p>You could hear the shrieks of women, the wailing of infants, and the shouting of men; some were calling their parents, others their children or their wives, trying to recognize them by their voices. People bewailed their own fate or that of their relatives, and there were some who prayed for death in their terror of dying. Many besought the aid of the gods, but still more imagined there were no gods left, and that the universe was plunged into eternal darkness for evermore.</p>
    <p>There were people, too, who added to the real perils by inventing fictitious dangers: some reported that part of Misenum had collapsed or another part was on fire, and though their tales were false, they found others to believe them. A gleam of light returned, but we took this to be a warning of the approaching flames rather than daylight. However, the flames remained some distance off; then darkness came on once more and ashes began to fall again, this time in heavy showers. We rose from time to time and shook them off, otherwise we should have been buried and crushed beneath their weight. I could boast that not a groan or cry of fear escaped me in these perils, but I admit that I derived some poor consolation in my mortal lot from the belief that the whole world was dying with me and I with it.  </p>

    <p><span class="firstcharacter">D</span>aniel Pelaez is the type of man you need to meet during college study abroad. In general, I would not consider myself a risk taker. In fact, I would consider myself to be quite risk averse. But Dan knew how to make people feel comfortable outside of their comfort zone. He might even banish the very idea of a comfort zone altogether. </p>
    <p>Croatians have a very different definition of beaches than Americans. In America, beaches are where the ocean meets sand. Specifically, it&#39;s the sand itself that is the beach. In Croatia, the beach is any humanly accessible place where the land touches water, and all the &quot;beaches&quot; that I saw in Dubrovnik were rocks and water. </p>
    <p>Sometimes big rocks where you could sun yourself and sometimes small rocks that made it hard to walk on. But always rocks. </p>
    <p>The other distinguishing feature of Croatian beaches is that many of them are nude beaches. I am not one to typically frequent a nude beach, but again, it almost felt like the appropriate thing to do at the time. Before each excursion, the Semester at Sea staff would give a brief rundown of the culture and customs of whatever port we were visiting. For Croatia, they discussed the fraught political history following the collapse of Yugoslavia and the etiquette around nude beaches.</p>
    <p>There were two rules: no staring and if you are to go to one of these beaches, you must be nude. </p>
    <p>So I found myself at one of these beaches, sitting atop a large rock, with three or four of my more adventurous friends, each of us trying our very best to do anything but to even glance at one another. </p>
    <p>Daniel, who seemed completely unperturbed by the situation, suggested that we go cliff diving. We walked along the rocks until we saw a spot where many Semester at Sea students had gathered and were taking turns diving off the cliffs. To my immediate discomfort, most of them did in fact have on bathing suits. </p>
    <p>I walked over to the cliff edge. It was about a twenty foot drop to the water. I watched a naked man jump and belly flop directly into the water. Everyone winced. I didn&#39;t think that I could jump. I must have stood at cliff edge for nearly ten minutes, contemplating myself smacking against the side of the rocks and into the water.</p>
    <p>Nina, a friend of mine who had come separately, walked over. &quot;You know I think it&#39;s really brave what you are doing. I could never do that.&quot; </p>
    <p>What do you mean, I asked her. I hadn&#39;t even jumped yet. &quot;No not that&quot;, she responded, &quot;You&#39;re naked. I couldn&#39;t do that.&quot;</p>
    <p>I jumped into the water and trekked back across the rocks to retrieve my swim trunks.</p>

<div class = "para-tex">
    <p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span> red A circumscribed by a messy red circle. Every building is covered in graffiti, most have this mark. Packs of dogs roam through the streets. Athens has both modern and ancient ruins. The city of Athens itself is not beautiful. But the acropolis that juts up from the city center is breathtaking. It is the birthplace of democracy, the cradle of western civilization, and it is hot. The first day the acropolis had to be closed because two died of heat stroke. The temperature topped over 115. It was a drier heat though, not like the wet smuggy heat of Croatia. But it permeated through the day and stuck with you when you got back on the ship, only coming off in the shower.</p>
    <p>A ferry ride from graffitied buildings of Athens, the Greek islands are a different beast entirely. The anger and protest can be felt in the air in Athens. The islands seemed to have avoided this so far. I went to Aegea, a smaller lesser known island compared to the tourist behemoths of Myknosos and San Torini. Aegea however was spectacular. The port was surrounded by little frappe cafes, gyro shops, and a beach for the tourists. </p>
    <p>I had decided to spend the day alone and broke off from the group. Beyond the beach rose a little pile of ruins, with a single column stretching up at the center. Alone in the park, I made way up the ancient steps that dated back to the classic era, up to the column. The view was breathtaking. To my right was the port and tourist district, packed with people. It is amazing how little people travel from the ferry. To my left was a smaller white sand beach opening out onto crystal blue waters enclosed by blue tinted mountains. The island stretched across behind me, backing into a small mountain. Patches of olive groves could be seen among the white washed buildings. Aegea was breath taking, and it was time to explore it. I put my water bottle back in my bag after taking a swig. I pushed into the island. Mopeds weaved through cobble stone allies. My stomach rumbled as I looked for fresh gyros. The Latin alphabet was still being used in all the restaurant signs. I hadn&#39;t gone far enough inland.</p>
    <p>Wander isnt a strong enough term for what I did. Wander implies a knowledge, some sort of understanding of where I was going. It sounds almost lazy. No, I was active. I lost myself. I pushed past the cramped markets in the ally, past the houses and zipping cars. Deeper and deeper inland, until nothing was for tourists and everything was Greek. The international sign of gyros is a rotating spit, sitting vertical next to an open flame. I felt like I had found an oasis when I finally came across one. I walked up to the counter and gestured to the spit, and then something magic happened. The woman behind the bar did not speak English. After days in Athens of looking for an &quot;authentic&quot; Greek gyro shop, I found one here in Aegea. The magic died when she could not understand what I wanted, no matter how emphatically I gestured. The Greek word for gyro is pronounced the same as Euro, something that has caused confusion on several occasions. Luckily someone else walked into the store who did speak English. I swear English is the new Latin, all of Europe speaks it. The gyros were fresh pork and lamb cut right off the fire roasted spit, green crunchy lettuce, juicy tomatoes, and tangy tzatziki sauce with some sort of mystery powder that tasted sort of like msg. I immediately scarfed mine down. And quickly went back to order a second. They were only a euro forty, but each felt like a meal.</p>
    <p>I stumbled out in a food coma and took a left when I should have gone right. I walked for miles. The occasional shop turned to the occasional house. I was surrounded by olive groves. Beautiful, but not useful. After around twenty minutes of walking, I heard soft Greek voices, coming from an open window. After surely breaking some sort of peeping tom law, I poked my head in and asked, &quot;English?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said a half dressed old Greek woman. &quot;Port?&quot; &quot;Around thirty minutes that way.&quot; She gestured widely to the exact opposite direction from which I had come. I thanked her and was on my way. Mediterranean hospitality at its finest.</p>
    <p>I made it back to my little spot atop the ruins, and spread myself out with Illiad. Everything just fit. The sprawling mountains rising from the sea, the wine and gyros still turning in my stomach. I laughed with excitement when I read the line &quot;soldiers from Aegea&quot; in my book. I felt history and literature had come full circle on this little island. I could spend all day on this ruin. But just then, a fat little Greek man came driving up on an impossibly small motorcycle. He was mad, but I knew the drill. I broke out my dumb tourist face and sold it hard. He yelled and yelled at me. I shrugged my shoulders, showed my ticket, and through a nervous smile eked out &quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot; For around two minutes the exchange went this way. Until finally he said the word &quot;closed.&quot; I got the picture and started walking to the exit. He patted my back heartily and even offered a high five. The Greeks are to say the least an expressive people.</p>
    <p>Greece is advertised as the classical Greece. Athens in all its glory has long changed to a heavily graffitied European Brooklyn. The beauty lies in the islands, specifically the random ones. You can find the beauty in Greece, far back, past the markets and Latin alphabet, where the cobble stone roads become unpaved and a lamb spit slowly rotates in a little restaurant, just a block or two from the olive groves.</p>

    <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he air was thick with sweet hookah smoke. We passed the pipe around. I took a long pull. &quot;Suck it in like a straw&quot; I was told. A small man dressed in a traditional Turkish shirt and Levi jeans put on fresh coals. The only drinks sold in the bar were milkshakes. Welcome to Turkey, the oddest mix of east and west in the world.</p>
    <p>The wailing call to prayer blasted out from loud speakers perched on ancient minarets. The call penetrated every corner of the city. It was Ramadan. The faithful kept fast from dawn to dusk, but most drank the Effes beer and ate kebabs during the day. We walked in the square between the blue mosque and the Hagia Sophia as prayer rugs were being laid out. At night the city came alive, the slow sluggish hungry pace of the city turned to 13 million person celebration. Every square was packed with laughing Turks, guzzling wine and water. Night clubs were filled with old Turkish men, frighteningly fascinated with American women. </p>
    <p>We were on our way to one of those clubs that night. I&#39;ve never been a big fan of partying and dancing, so I was hesitant to go, but Marimar convinced me. I would playfully pretend that I should turn back to the ship and spend the night in my cabin reading books and studying. She would lead me forward, telling me that tonight was about fun.</p>
    <p>It was a girl&#39;s birthday party that night, which is why such a large group of us were headed out to the same bar. Marimar and I were not the first to arrive and the second we stepped in, a girl who I did not really know ran up and hugged me and told me how happy she was that I had come. </p>
    <p>I&#39;m pretty sure she was happy that everyone came, as she proceeded to hug every other guy in our group. Marimar dragged me out to the dance floor. She wrapped her arms around my neck, and I held her by the hips. I found myself confused about the state of our friendship. I had entered the night under the assumption that we were just friends, even though we had shared a kiss in the past. </p>
    <p>She was certainly someone I was interested in. She was cute, funny, and laid back. Talking felt effortless. I was less than a two years removed from an all boy high school education, so not many women felt like this to me. </p>
    <p>I&#39;ve never been good at reading the intentions of women, and looking back, I must have come off as reserved and distant, maybe even uninterested. None the less, we danced together, song after song. She held me closer and closer, and I did the same to her. </p>
    <p>Eventually, I told her that I needed a break. She looked frustrated. </p>
    <p>I sat down at a picnic table and drank a beer. A few people came up to me and asked if Marimar and I were dating. Slightly confused but mostly embarrassed, I told them that we were friends. While I sat drinking beer and having half hearted conversations with my friends, Marimar began dancing with someone else. </p>
    <p>I would cut in for a song or two, but I could tell that her mood had changed. There was more distance between us. She danced more and more with this other man, and the next day, she told me that they had gone home together. </p>

    <p><span class="firstcharacter">S</span>hakira put her head in my lap. Her jaw rotating up and down on the imaginary grass she was not chewing. &quot;I think she likes you.&quot; Our guide smiled a thick toothless grin. He had let me lead the camel pack because I was the only guy. Shakira was the name of the camel behind me. Madonna was my camel. She was slow moving, not too bumpy. With a firm pat on my back, the guide had told me she was the best camel in the pack. </p>
    <p>Halfway through our half hour &quot;trek&quot;, she did make a bee line for a tree for an impromptu feeding session, until the guide whacked her back onto the trail. Getting off the camel was probably the biggest challenge. They are not short animals, taller than horses. You don&#39;t realize that until its time to get off and the guides walk over with palm leaves and thawack the camel&#39;s knees until it quickly bows down, lurching you forward. They don&#39;t hurt the animals, more annoy them into submission.</p>
    <p>Turkey in many ways was a trial run for Morocco. Morocco basically took every Turkish custom to their illogical extreme, at least from my western point of view. The patriarchal culture was intoxicating, as sad as I am to say. Having strangers look to you first was exhilarating, even though it degraded those around me. Cabs wouldn&#39;t rip me off, shopkeepers gave me the best deal, and waiters asked me what we all were having. In other words, I got the best camel.</p>
    <p>We got off the train in Marrakesh, stepping out into 125 degree heat. It was a dry heat. The air sucked the moisture out of your eyes, dried out your lungs, and settled in your clothes. You didn&#39;t sweat. You just felt like you were standing in a dryer. Despite the heat, Ramadan was kept in Morocco. No one ate, and more significantly, no one drank. Not a single restaurant was open. We only were able to eat at Mcdonald&#39;s. I had packed 3 liters of water in my back pack and would enter shops and guzzle it in the back corner. It is against the law in Morocco to eat or drink outdoors during Ramadan, a far cry from the kebabs of Turkey.</p>
    <p>We wandered through the hive of shops in Marrakesh called the Medina. You would buy a trinket from one of the shops towards the entrance of the medina and then a random man would come up and ask how much you paid for whatever you got. He would then tell you what a good price you had gotten and ask what else you are looking for and whisk you through the medina to the appropriate shop. </p>
    <p>These people are a kind of guide, hired by shops to direct tourists to their stores. They raise the price up a little bit when you haggle, but they are worth it. Our guide took us into a Moroccan pharmacy. We stepped out of the dusty streets of the medina into a unnaturally white building, were plopped down on metal benches and told that &quot;the doctor will be right up.&quot; We looked at all the plants in jars that lined the walls and then to each other, confused and nervous. The doctor came up in a white lab coat and pulled down jars of plants to show us. Apparently in Morocco pharmacy means teas shop because all the plants were different teas, digestive teas, caffeinated teas, teas to help with love, teas to help with luck. We bought the mint tea, for the taste, not the &quot;medical benefits.&quot;</p>
    <p>Morocco is best seen from the inside of a cab, zooming through the sand swept streets. You are always on the edge of your seat in a Moroccan cab. There are no traffic laws. People cut across the street, cars sit in two lanes, and horses run alongside traffic. 90 is not unheard of on a city street. But you see it all blurring past your window, from the workers on the street, threading carpet, to the seemingly endless construction, to the places that need constructing the most. The best view in Morocco is definitely in a cab, not from a camel.</p>

    <p>She passed me back a Cuban cigar I had bought in Greece. I took a puff, tilted my head back and exhaled. It was the last night, and there was sense of fatalism in the air. Barrio Alto was filled with students rushing from bar to bar, hoping to suck out every last sweet moment. The bars had closed. I had bought two Super Bocks from an African street vendor and retreated with a friend into a back ally to enjoy one last moment of intoxicated silence, to find a place of quiet reminiscence.</p>
    <p>No one walked into Portugal with a list of sights to see, museums to tour, or food to try. It was blank slate, a palate cleanser after a long journey. What we found was something else entirely. We found vibrate modern art alongside renaissance squares. Street art by cobble stone roads. Old and new swirled together in an unbelievable mix of art and history. Once you get past the language itself, which a Mexican man described as &quot;Espanol borracho&quot; or drunk Spanish, and the fried egg cracked over every meat, the Portuguese lifestyle is the same as ours.</p>
    <p>After a long unfruitful search for unbooked hostel, we wandered down a side street and stumbled onto a little hole in the wall bar, where a liter of beer was two euros. Clashing personalities eased as we sat out on the street as trucks and cars came precariously close to running over our toes. Every night Barrio Alto would flood with students and locals alike, all looking to relax, and every night we would look for that same little bar, but we could never find it. It seemed to have sunken back into a drunk Portuguese crowd. That&#39;s all Portugal was for most of us. Beautiful sites, great food and parties each night, and that&#39;s all we wanted.</p>
    <p>It is hard to think about ends and beginnings. An ending is a small moment, no longer than any other. But as I sat there on the side of the road, I could only think about the end of this trip. The moment I would swipe my card out of the ship for the last time. The instance I would step off the gangway and onto the shore. The first time in months my feet would be planted on american soil. All moments that were quick and sweet as the moments I spent thinking about them. </p>
    <p>Smoke swirled above me, fading away into the night sky. My head was swimming. I was burning through that cigar. I guess I didn&#39;t really understand how good it tastes. It tasted like every other cigar I had had before. I looked down at the cigar and watched orange slowly burn through brown, leaving little grey ashes. I tapped it. I was focused on that moment, that cigar, that night, that city street. I took a swig of beer and put the cigar out on the sidewalk sending a swirl of embers into the air. Soon this would all be over. </p>
    <p>All the people I had met would scatter back to their respective cities and colleges. Marimar would go back to Boston. Naomi would go back to Arizona, Daniel would go to Florida. </p>
    <p>There was a tradition at Semester at Sea. Instead of signing year books, we would sign big maps of the world. I gathered everyones signature and read their notes. Marimar wrote, &quot;Dear future husband, I&#39;m sorry we never had the chance to date&quot;, punctuated by a smiley face. </p>
    <p>It was half serious and half a joke. </p>
    <p>She was one of the few people I would keep up with. We would chat over Facebook and on the phone. But what she wrote was true. We never had a chance to date. A few months later, we were talking online, and she told me that there once was something between us. That burned me a bit since we had never given it a proper shot. </p>
    <p>In the years that followed, she would go on to marry an engineer in Boston and have a daughter named Mariela. Naomi would become a doctor, and Dan would lead slot canyon tours in Utah. We all went our separate ways, and that summer we spent on a ship touring the Mediterranean would become a cherished but distant memory. </p>
