    <p><span class="first-character">L</span>ouisiana is fiercely proud of its French heritage, or at least in maintaining the appearance of French heritage. Its signature dishes, Cajun and Creole, combine African flavors, local ingredients, and saucy French techniques into a cultural institution. The wrought iron  balconies of French colonials line streets with names like Toulouse, Dauphine, and Bourbon. At one end of Jackson Square sits Saint Louis Cathedral, a white triple steepled structure, reminiscent of a European castle, and at the other end, Cafe Du Monde, a famous tourist trap, dishing out long lines, beignets, and French coffee. </p>
    <p>I was staying in New Orleans for a long weekend with Michael Bunting, a friend of mine from work. We would be staying in HI Hostel at the top of the French Quarter, along Canal Street. We had come the weekend after Mardi Gras and found a city nursing a collective hangover. </p>
    <p>Signs of life remained however. The illicit bead trade continued after hours on Bourbon street, and past midnight the entire French Quarter devolved into what Michael described as a medieval morality play, with random fights and arguments between strangers, drunken women and men stumbling down piss covered roads, and constant interjections of street vendors, hawking tarot card readings. </p>
    <p>This presented sensory overload for two data scientists who largely did not drink anymore. </p>
    <p>However, the jazz clubs of Frenchman&#39;s street proved perfect. We went with a British fellow from our hostel named Adrian. He had been in town for the past week, and needed a rest from partying. All of New Orleans most famous jazz clubs line Frenchman&#39;s Street, and we stopped in Maison first, listening to a retro Rock &#39;n&#39; Roll band play old classics. </p>
    <p>Part of the character of New Orleans comes from the flat out strange individuals it draws to it. Before we could enter the club, we dutifully presented proof of vaccination and ID to the bouncer. About fifteen or so into the set list, an old man in a dark purple pinstripe suit and fedora carrying a large staff, wrapped in beads, approached the doorman. The doorman meekly asked for proof of vaccination, while the old man, who we nicknamed the spirit of New Orleans, looked vacantly past him, and without acknowledging his request, wandered into the bar. </p>
    <p>He proceeded to stand uncomfortably close to a group of girls and lick his lips, before circling the bar once and exiting the club. On his way out, he signaled to the doorman that he wanted him to take his staff and stamp it on the ground. The doorman obliged and just like that, the spirit of New Orleans left. </p>
    <p>We followed him out and listened to a brass band play underneath a neon sign that read &quot;Willie&#39;s Chicken Shack&quot;. A small crowd began to form, and people began to dance.        </p>
    <p>Michael remarked that its was like we were in a Pepsi commercial. I couldn&#39;t help but agree.</p>

    <p><span class="first-character">S</span>panish moss hung like decorations on the sprawling bald cypress trees that lined the roads from New Orleans to Lafitte. Houses, even those blocks inland from the coast, sat on stilts to withstand the inevitable flooding. Our Uber driver told us that there used to be speed cameras around here, but someone had gone around and destroyed them all. The local government did not bother putting them back up.</p>
    <p>We were going on a airboat tour of the bayou. Our airboat driver and tour guide would be a stout balding man with a thick Louisiana accent. Michael and I packed into the boat with about twelve other individuals. We skated along the water, exploring different creeks and streams. It was near sunset and the golden rays of light poked through the branches and moss that hung off the trees. </p>
    <p>We spotted a family of alligators sunning themselves on an exposed rock. Our guide pulled the boat as close as he could. The gators remained unperturbed, their wide unintelligent eyes watching us come nearer and nearer, until by instinct they slithered off their rock and into the water. </p>
    <p>We repeated this process again and again, oohing and ahhing, each time frantically taking pictures as if it was our first and last time seeing a gator. </p>
    <p>Upon seeing a gator swimming alongside the boat, our guide broke the one hard and fast rule of the excursion and stuck his hand over the side of the ship. The gator jumped out of the water to bite the hand, which the guide expertly pulled away and instead was used to pet the gator&#39;s chin as it slid back into the water.</p>
    <p>After spotting perhaps another ten or so gators, our guide took us further and further into the bayou, through a creek and into an opening. He stopped the boat and pointed to a refrigerator that was washed ashore. </p>
    <p>&quot;You see that? That&#39;s from the hurricane last year. Matter of fact, all of what you see around you used to be land before that hurricane.&quot; We stared out into what looked like miles of water. &quot;Pull up google maps. It will tell you we are still on land. They haven&#39;t updated the maps yet.&quot;</p>
    <p>Coming in, I was surprised by the intense rural character of Lafitte. We were only thirty minutes out from downtown, yet there was very little in the way of homes. Now that made much more sense--as the question of whether or not the land will be there after a intense storm remains open ended.  </p>
