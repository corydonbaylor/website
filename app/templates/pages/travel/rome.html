    <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he modern roman way of living is summed up in one word: <em>arrangiarsi</em>, which in English roughly translate to &quot;we will figure it out.&quot; </p>
    <p>Trains are on strike? &quot;Eh, <em>arrangiarsi</em>.&quot; </p>
    <p>Hotel keys don&#39;t unlock the front door? <em>Arrangiarsi.</em></p>
    <p>Pedestrians need to cross three lanes of traffic? &quot;Let&#39;s just slap down a painted cross walk, and I don&#39;t know, they will <em>arrangairsi</em> from there.&quot; </p>
    <p>So what happens when a very &quot;Type A&quot; tourist visits a very &quot;Type B &quot;country? Nothing short of disaster. </p>
    <p>Upon arriving to my hotel, my aggressively chill inn keeper (for lack of a more modern word) informed me that he will only accept cash as payment for the stay, because he &quot;doesn&#39;t get online banking.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Oh&mdash;I didn&#39;t realize. I didn&#39;t bring that much cash,&quot; I stammered, suddenly keenly aware that I did not bring a debit card. And definitely aware that I didn&#39;t bring enough cash to cover <em><strong>nine whole nights</strong></em>.</p>
    <p>&quot;That&#39;s fine, you can just pay me at the end of your stay,&quot; Frankie replied.</p>
    <p>I wanted to say: &quot;Well its actually not fine because I don&#39;t have money to pay you, and I would think you would be at very least equally concerned about that as I am.&quot;</p>
    <p>But Frankie wasn&#39;t concerned.  </p>
    <p>That initial interaction set the tone for how I came to understand the modern southern Italian attitude about life. There is just a sort of looseness to order that I was not anticipating in a first world country. Cars intermingled with pedestrians on the street. Lines snaked far back and turned into crowds. Scammers aggressively pitched their &quot;wares&quot; without fear of law enforcement. </p>
    <p>Yet, the romans still <em>arrangairsi</em>. </p>
    <p>Frankie and I would <em>arrangairsi</em> about the payment eventually. He agreed to allow me to paypal his girlfriend the full balance, which only took a couple of attempts and a few not-so-Type-B messages from Frankie and his unnamed girlfriend.</p>
    <p>One of my hotel mates, Pierre, was also unaware of the all cash policy prior to arriving and was considering just not paying them at all. Perhaps he made a better Roman than me.</p>

    <p><span class="firstcharacter">R</span>oman emperors once described ruling over the mobs of Rome as riding on the back of a wolf. You grasp as long and tightly as you can until you inevitably get bitten. Visiting modern Rome can feel the same. </p>
    <p>It takes a day or two to get your mind around the city center. Here you will find the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona, and of course, the much older Pantheon. I call this section Renaissance Rome. It&#39;s pretty compact, being only about half a square mile in size and is filled at any given moment with tens of thousands of tourists. The whole thing feels like Times Square. </p>
    <p>Walking the streets, I am surprised that moped drivers don&#39;t collect pedestrians like flys on a windshield. The narrow, crooked, and cobbled streets of the city center don&#39;t really have room to accommodate both pedestrians and vehicles&mdash; yet all they coexist in that crammed space. </p>
    <p>Moreover, the pedestrians are usually the tourist sort&mdash; ones whose faces are either buried in their phones or staring wide eyed at the various medieval and renaissance houses. Cars eek through the crowds as if they are trying to escape a riot, which according to my American sensibilities, they appear to be.</p>
    <p>It takes a few days, but eventually Rome does get better.</p>
    <p>The second day, or perhaps the third, you will come to appreciate the space more and more. Having taken pictures at all the major spots, you will walk a more leisurely pace.  You will have your first pistachio gelato, or maybe you will discover a hidden pasta spot&mdash;<em>for me, Pastificio Guerra with its five euro trays of pasta</em>.  The tangled web of medieval streets will feel inviting rather than confusing. You&#39;ll begin to navigate by church steeples, following lines of sights from each dome to the next, rather than by google maps. You&#39;ll find yourself along the Tiber&#39;s edge, watching boats pass with the pale blue dome of Saint Peter&#39;s Basilica and the graceful stone arches of the Ponte bridge in the background. </p>
    <p>When the crowds dissipate, when the pace slows, when you begin to wander, you tame the wolf.</p>

    <p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span>ncient columns in Rome look delicate, and they can almost feel accidental in their placement. You will inevitably see a few when walking along the southern rim of the city center. Take Largo di Torre Argentina for example. </p>
    <p>Discovered in 1927 during routine construction work, it&#39;s an open pit, consisting of a few columns and the foundation stones for Pompey&#39;s theater. It sits at a major intersection, and you might pass by it without a second thought on the way from the Pantheon to the Coliseum. </p>
    <p>Such was the case of the Theatre of Marcellus for me. I was on my way to Jewish Quarter to see the Mouth of Truth when I spotted strange mishmash of a building. Its bottom floors were an ancient arcade on top of which rested a comparatively modern series of medieval apartments. I instinctively headed toward the educational placards that accompanied this complex. </p>
    <p>It was an ancient theater! Originally, built in the late roman republic, and&mdash; a true rarity for Rome&mdash; it was both free to explore and empty of tourists. </p>
    <p>A narrow gravel path, dotted with informational placards, wandered its way around the theater, through a few free standing pillars, and by a temple of Jupiter. The path serves as a vital short cut between the neighborhoods of Sant&#39;Angelo and Ripa, meaning its function is as practical as it is historical. </p>
    <p>I do love the more well trod ruins of Ancient Rome. I loved seeing the Coliseum. I loved it bathed in afternoon glow, peaking out between buildings in the adjacent neighborhoods. I loved walking the worn steps up the different levels of the stadium. I loved walking from there, past the Triumphal Arches of Constantine and Titus, and into the Forum. I love imagining the bustle of the city. I loved hiking the Palatine Hill, seeing the orchards and gardens and the remains of Augustus&#39; palace&mdash; and even seeing the supposed hut of Romulus himself.</p>
    <p>But I love it more when the ruins rise up from beneath the cramped streets of Rome. When they are uncovered in the construction of something pedestrian and modern like a McDonald&#39;s. When the cranes and plows are stopped because a bit of ancient marble is found poking out from the dirt. When the ever expanding machine of modernity gives way to antiquity. When something is preserved not because it is useful nor even because it is beautiful, but simply because it was there first.</p>

    <p><span class="firstcharacter">W</span>e watched the city center turn to suburbs, then to farmhouses, then to nothing at all. We were on the Norman coast now. We pressed on as the rain misted around us, kicked up by the blowing wind. Long lapping waves stretched across the white sand beach, forming a tide pool that stretched miles out to sea.</p>
    <p>Mount Saint Michael stood on the other side of a bridge&mdash; a delicate castle, built atop of a massive hunk of granite. It looked as if a giant had scooped out a mountaintop abbey and placed it gently on the shore. The tide was in and water danced with the drizzle of rain. </p>
    <p>As we crossed, the weathered white granite walls of the city came into clearer focus. The little town of enclosed blue roofs and hewn wood windows frames, all built to support the monks who mediated in the castle above, drew closer with each step. </p>
    <p>We passed through the city gate and followed the town&#39;s single road as it wound its way to up to the abbey at the mountain top. Entering the abbey, the drizzle stopped, and the spring sun opened up on a plaza overlooking the tidal pool. Its waters began to pull back, revealing soft wet sand. We entered the temple. </p>
    <p>Inside, beneath the soft rainbow light cast by a massive stained glass window, monks strode across the chapel floor deep in prayer, lighting candles and reciting hymns under their breath. </p>
    <p>A place like this is the pinnacle of human achievement. It fills no practical purpose&mdash; other than to offer any of those lucky enough to pass through their doors what we all are searching for&mdash;a connection to something larger. </p>
    <p>Humanity is unique in that we are conscious of the fleeting nature of both ourselves and of the world. And when we encounter things that seem to defy that fundamental law&mdash; the sweeping view from a mountain top, pillars of rocks standing against massive waves crashing on a black sand beach, or an ancient abbey sitting on a rocky outcrop&mdash; we are filled with a sense of awe. These thing existed before me. And when I am gone, I am sure they will exist still.</p>
    <p>That same impulse is the source of our fascination with history. Ceaser conquering Gaul has no real impact on my day to day life, but if an act as consequential as that cannot be immortalized as meaningful then what meaning can be found in anything I do.</p>
    <p>I can steal a bit of meaning in a place like this. </p>
    <p>I can walk the same worn steps, through the same doors, and see different monks perform the same prayers&mdash; all unchanged from centuries before. I can light a candle in the back by the pews, drawing a connection to all those who had done so before. I am captivated to do what they did in such a beautiful and ancient place. And when people light a candle in the future, they will similarly captivated by the fact that I had done it in the past. I become a part of the tradition, of the journey, of the draw of a place like this. </p>
    <p>The flame lights the wick, and the connection is drawn. The candle never really goes out and neither will you. </p>

    <p><span class="firstcharacter">W</span>e were never supposed to see a place like this. King Louis IX built it, not as a place of worship, but as a reliquary for his stash of holy relics, bought from Constantinople, including what he believed to be Jesus&#39; crown of thorns. </p>
    <p>Megan and I stood there as the soft light from the cloudy midday sun lit the stained glass. The walls are almost entirely composed of 15 massive stain glass windows, each standing 50 feet tall. The supports between the glass led up to a vaulted ceiling, painted a dark royal blue. There was perhaps fifty other people in the room, though it remained quiet, occasionally enforced by a &quot;shush&quot; by the staff that guarded the chamber. </p>
    <p>At the front sits an alter, where presumably the crown of thorns would rest&mdash;like a throne for a ghostly king. I imagine that King Louis kept commoners out of this room, not just to prevent damage to his costly relics, but so that the ephemeral nature of the crown room would remain unperturbed, inhabited only by the dull colored light of the stained glass, by the wisps of smoke from chandeliers, and by the crown sitting atop the empty throne. A court for the divine, where King Louis hoped to lure the Holy Spirit with his crown of thorns, where the disciples could gather in peace. An eternal place, undisturbed or changed by the city around it.</p>

    <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span> felt the heavy tug of my back pack as I rode the scooter. The asphalt had just turned to cobbles meaning I had just entered the untamed labyrinth of the city center. </p>
    <p>Approximately six hours ago, I had found myself hunched over in Milan, unable to stand or even speak after slipping on some wet marble. A crowd formed around me, and I remember an Italian woman repeatedly asking if I needed help and being incapable gathering breath to answer. </p>
    <p>On my way back to Rome, my high speed rail train came to a screeching halt in Bologna, and I had to deboard and ride another train to make it back to Rome. By the time I arrived, I was three hours late, and the subway had closed, leaving me without a way to get back to the hotel. </p>
    <p>I spotted a Bird scooter out of the corner of my eye and decided to take that while waiting in the cab line. </p>
    <p>The truth is that travel isn&#39;t easy for me, and I often hate my vacations when I am on them. It takes way too much for me to fall asleep and far too little to upset my stomach. I like a sure thing, and that&#39;s not something that you can often find abroad. The lows are so much lower in a foreign land than they are at home. But so are the highs. </p>
    <p>I go not because I expect to have a great time the whole time I am there, but because the prospect of spending a life at home isn&#39;t worth living.  </p>
    <p>That night, the warm fall air felt oddly silent. It was past midnight, and the city was nearly empty. I traced the curved streets from the Spanish Steps down to the Trevi Fountain. The throngs of tourists crowding the fountain had dissipated, and just a few college students were left gathered around it, splitting a six pack of beers. I felt like a bit of scenery decorating a core memory of theirs&mdash; and they filled that role for me. </p>
    <p>When I first started riding, I made the closest thing to a bee line as possible to the hotel. But soon, I began to meander and before I knew it, my scooter ride had devolved into an hour and half long tour of the eternal city. </p>
    <p>If I hadn&#39;t fallen, if the train hadn&#39;t been late, if I hadn&#39;t gotten back after the subway closed, I wouldn&#39;t have seen the Coliseum glow orange in the darkness of night. I wouldn&#39;t have seen the Spanish steps with nearly no one on them. I wouldn&#39;t have ridden across the Ponte Sant&#39;Angelo with just me and the angels. </p>
    <p>I wouldn&#39;t have seen Rome in a new light&mdash; tranquil and serene; a city of peace and beauty&mdash; brooding, like a dark blue water color or an establishing shot to a moody detective flick. The spiraling labyrinth at the center of the city unwound for me that night, offering a glimpse at Rome more relaxed, as if to say: &quot;There is charm and beauty here. Relax and it will come to you, and even if you only see it for a moment, the whole thing will be worth it.&quot;</p>
