    <p><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he modern roman way of living is summed up in one word: <em>arrangiarsi</em>, which in English roughly translate to &quot;we will figure it out.&quot; </p>
    <p>Trains are on strike? &quot;Eh, <em>arrangiarsi</em>.&quot; </p>
    <p>Hotel keys don&#39;t unlock the front door? <em>Arrangiarsi.</em></p>
    <p>Pedestrians need to cross three lanes of traffic? &quot;Let&#39;s just slap down a painted cross walk, and I don&#39;t know, they will <em>arrangairsi</em> from there.&quot; </p>
    <p>So what happens when a very &quot;Type A&quot; tourist visits a very &quot;Type B &quot;country? Nothing short of disaster. </p>
    <p>Upon arriving to my hotel, my aggressively chill inn keeper (for lack of a more modern word) informed me that he will only accept cash as payment for the stay, because he &quot;doesn&#39;t get online banking.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Oh&mdash;I didn&#39;t realize. I didn&#39;t bring that much cash,&quot; I stammered, suddenly keenly aware that I did not bring a debit card. And definitely aware that I didn&#39;t bring enough cash to cover <em><strong>nine whole nights</strong></em>.</p>
    <p>&quot;That&#39;s fine, you can just pay me at the end of your stay,&quot; Frankie replied.</p>
    <p>I wanted to say: &quot;Well its actually not fine because I don&#39;t have money to pay you, and I would think you would be at very least equally concerned about that as I am.&quot;</p>
    <p>But Frankie wasn&#39;t concerned.  </p>
    <p>That initial interaction set the tone for how I came to understand the modern southern Italian attitude about life. There is just a sort of looseness to order that I was not anticipating in a first world country. Cars intermingled with pedestrians on the street. Lines snaked far back and turned into crowds. Scammers aggressively pitched their &quot;wares&quot; without fear of law enforcement. </p>
    <p>Yet, the romans still <em>arrangairsi</em>. </p>
    <p>Frankie and I would <em>arrangairsi</em> about the payment eventually. He agreed to allow me to paypal his girlfriend the full balance, which only took a couple of attempts and a few not-so-Type-B messages from Frankie and his unnamed girlfriend.</p>
    <p>One of my hotel mates, Pierre, was also unaware of the all cash policy prior to arriving and was considering just not paying them at all. Perhaps he made a better Roman than me.</p>

<div class="para-tex">
    <p><span class="firstcharacter">R</span>oman emperors once described ruling over the mobs of Rome as riding on the back of a wolf. You grasp as long and tightly as you can until you inevitably get bitten. Visiting modern Rome can feel the same. </p>
    <p>It takes a day or two to get your mind around the city center. Here you will find the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona, and of course, the much older Pantheon. I call this section Renaissance Rome. It&#39;s pretty compact, being only about half a square mile in size and is filled at any given moment with tens of thousands of tourists. The whole thing feels like Times Square. </p>
    <p>Walking the streets, I am surprised that moped drivers don&#39;t collect pedestrians like flys on a windshield. The narrow, crooked, and cobbled streets of the city center don&#39;t really have room to accommodate both pedestrians and vehicles&mdash; yet all they coexist in that crammed space. </p>
    <p>Moreover, the pedestrians are usually the tourist sort&mdash; ones whose faces are either buried in their phones or staring wide eyed at the various medieval and renaissance houses. Cars eek through the crowds as if they are trying to escape a riot, which according to my American sensibilities, they appear to be.</p>
    <p>It takes a few days, but eventually Rome does get better.</p>
    <p>The second day, or perhaps the third, you will come to appreciate the space more and more. Having taken pictures at all the major spots, you will walk a more leisurely pace.  You will have your first pistachio gelato, or maybe you will discover a hidden pasta spot&mdash;<em>for me, Pastificio Guerra with its five euro trays of pasta</em>.  The tangled web of medieval streets will feel inviting rather than confusing. You&#39;ll begin to navigate by church steeples, following lines of sights from each dome to the next, rather than by google maps. You&#39;ll find yourself along the Tiber&#39;s edge, watching boats pass with the pale blue dome of Saint Peter&#39;s Basilica and the graceful stone arches of the Ponte bridge in the background. </p>
    <p>When the crowds dissipate, when the pace slows, when you begin to wander, you tame the wolf.</p>

    <p><span class="firstcharacter">A</span>ncient columns in Rome look delicate, and they can almost feel accidental in their placement. You will inevitably see a few when walking along the southern rim of the city center. Take Largo di Torre Argentina for example. </p>
    <p>Discovered in 1927 during routine construction work, it&#39;s an open pit, consisting of a few columns and the foundation stones for Pompey&#39;s theater. It sits at a major intersection, and you might pass by it without a second thought on the way from the Pantheon to the Coliseum. </p>
    <p>Such was the case of the Theatre of Marcellus for me. I was on my way to Jewish Quarter to see the Mouth of Truth when I spotted strange mishmash of a building. Its bottom floors were an ancient arcade on top of which rested a comparatively modern series of medieval apartments. I instinctively headed toward the educational placards that accompanied this complex. </p>
    <p>It was an ancient theater! Originally, built in the late roman republic, and&mdash; a true rarity for Rome&mdash; it was both free to explore and empty of tourists. </p>
    <p>A narrow gravel path, dotted with informational placards, wandered its way around the theater, through a few free standing pillars, and by a temple of Jupiter. The path serves as a vital short cut between the neighborhoods of Sant&#39;Angelo and Ripa, meaning its function is as practical as it is historical. </p>
    <p>I do love the more well trod ruins of Ancient Rome. I loved seeing the Coliseum. I loved it bathed in afternoon glow, peaking out between buildings in the adjacent neighborhoods. I loved walking the worn steps up the different levels of the stadium. I loved walking from there, past the Triumphal Arches of Constantine and Titus, and into the Forum. I love imagining the bustle of the city. I loved hiking the Palatine Hill, seeing the orchards and gardens and the remains of Augustus&#39; palace&mdash; and even seeing the supposed hut of Romulus himself.</p>
    <p>But I love it more when the ruins rise up from beneath the cramped streets of Rome. When they are uncovered in the construction of something pedestrian and modern like a McDonald&#39;s. When the cranes and plows are stopped because a bit of ancient marble is found poking out from the dirt. When the ever expanding machine of modernity gives way to antiquity. When something is preserved not because it is useful nor even because it is beautiful, but simply because it was there first.</p>

<div class="para-tex">
    <p><span class="firstcharacter">E</span>ach morning, I would find myself either strolling or power walking along Via Ottaviano from my hotel towards the Vatican and into the city, my speed depending on what degree of late I was for that day&#39;s activities. Along my walk, I would pass massive manicured trees with pale green leaves and white flaky bark, flanked on either side by 19th century, upper society apartment buildings, each about five stories in height. Soon I would find myself Saint Peter&#39;s Square, looking at the frontage of the Basilica, with its round colonnade hoisting statues of various monks and saints. </p>
    <p>In the evenings, cutting through Vatican City would often be the quickest way home. My pace would always be leisurely. I would indulge in my surroundings, with the pale blue dome of the church rising over the city, drawing me back home like a magnet.  </p>
    <p>It&#39;s been said that: &quot;Rome didn&#39;t fall, it became the Catholic Church&quot;. It&#39;s a somewhat romantic notion&mdash; the idea that the most powerful force in the ancient era became the medieval era&#39;s most important institution. I suppose there is some truth to that.  </p>
    <p>Every tour guide will tell you&mdash; either at the coliseum or at the Vatican &mdash; that the travertine marble that clad the stadium was used to build Saint Peter&#39;s Basilica. And when you walk through the forum, you will notice most of the ancient temples are now affixed with a catholic cross. </p>
    <p>The Pantheon itself&mdash; which some would describe as the most extant roman building &mdash; was only preserved as it was in continuous use as a Catholic Church. Except, of course, its bronze cladding that was melted down to produce canons for the Vatican. Even Hadrian&#39;s Tomb owed its preservation to the church, first as a fort to protect the Vatican, then as papal apartments.</p>
    <p>My twice daily strolls past Saint Peter&#39;s were often a time for reflection, to listen to a podcast, to call home. There is a natural gravity to that place&mdash; even though it resides outside the main thrust of the city. It feels worthy of its position as the spiritual and physical home of one of the world&#39;s largest religion. </p>

    </div>
</div>
<div class="para-tex">
    <p><span class="firstcharacter">R</span>ome and Milan, Italy&#39;s two biggest cities, are in many ways polar opposites. In Rome, there is an overwhelming number of things to see and do. In Milan, there are two things to see&mdash; the duomo and the galleria&mdash; maybe, <em>maybe</em> the castle as a third. </p>
    <p>Getting around Rome is a hassle. The metro consists of two lines, none of which take you&mdash; outside of one stop by the Coliseum&mdash; anywhere close to where you want to go. In Milan, there is no place within the city center that you cannot visit within a fifteen minute walk of a metro stop, and the rest of the city is crisscrossed with delightfully retro yellow trolly cars.</p>
    <p>In Milan, the city is clean and orderly, from its tidy organized streets, down to the spotless and modern metro system. In Rome? Well, I think I have said enough about the state of Rome. </p>
    <p>I can visit Rome for a maximum of a week or two, but I could actually live in Milan. </p>
    <p>At its center lies the Piazza del Duomo with the Duomo di Milano, a veritable wedding cake of intricately white carved marble, lying at the easterly end; and Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II residing at the northernly end. The conjunction of these two buildings makes perhaps my favorite city square in the entire world. </p>
    <p>The galleria consists of two 19th century glass-vaulted arcades forming a cross with the intersecting point being a steel and glass domed octagon. The floor has mosaics depicting the coat of arms for the three capitals of the Kingdom of Italy&mdash; Florence, Rome, and Turin &mdash; plus a forth for Milan. Tourist, such as myself, are encouraged to spin around three time with their foot firmly planted on the bull&#39;s testicles from the Turin coat of arms&mdash; a supposed dig at the rival northern city. </p>
    <p>The piazza itself is lovely. It&#39;s home to hundreds of pigeons, which will randomly become agitated and fly up in a grand cloud before landing back again in another section of the square. </p>
    <p>Fanning out from the piazza is Via Dante, a pedestrianized street, walled in with beautiful 19th century apartment buildings, which leads you to Sforzeco Castle. </p>
    <p>It all feels very Parisian. It&#39;s a jumble of medieval streets made manageable by wide intersecting boulevards that cut diagonal through the city. The people seem more interested in their day to day than in selling trinkets or badgering you to go to their restaurant. </p>
    <p>It&#39;s a refreshing interlude needed to break up a trip to Rome. </p>

    <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span> felt the heavy tug of my back pack as I rode the scooter. The asphalt had just turned to cobbles meaning I had just entered the untamed labyrinth of the city center. </p>
    <p>Approximately six hours ago, I had found myself hunched over in Milan, unable to stand or even speak after slipping on some wet marble. A crowd formed around me, and I remember an Italian woman repeatedly asking if I needed help and being incapable of gathering breath to answer. </p>
    <p>On my way back to Rome, my high speed rail train came to a screeching halt in Bologna, and I had to deboard and ride another train to make it back. By the time I arrived, I was three hours late, and the subway had closed, leaving me without a way to get back to the hotel. </p>
    <p>I spotted a Bird scooter out of the corner of my eye and decided to take that while waiting in the cab line. </p>
    <p>The truth is that travel isn&#39;t easy for me. It takes way too much for me to fall asleep and far too little to upset my stomach. My back hurt, I was dead tired, and I knew that I had to go back to that miserable, cramped hotel room where I had spent so many restless nights.</p>
    <p>I was uncomfortable. But perhaps that&#39;s part of traveling. </p>
    <p>That night, the warm fall air felt oddly silent. It was past midnight, and the city was nearly empty. I traced the curved streets from the Spanish Steps down to the Trevi Fountain. The throngs of tourists crowding the fountain had dissipated, and just a few college students were left gathered around it, splitting a six pack of beers. I felt like a bit of scenery decorating a core memory of theirs&mdash; and they filled that role for me. </p>
    <p>When I first started riding, I made the closest thing to a bee line as possible to the hotel. But soon, I began to meander and before I knew it, my scooter ride had devolved into an hour and half long tour of the eternal city. </p>
    <p>If I hadn&#39;t fallen, if the train hadn&#39;t been late, if I hadn&#39;t gotten back after the subway closed, I wouldn&#39;t have seen the Coliseum glow orange in the darkness of night. I wouldn&#39;t have seen the Spanish steps with nearly no one on them. I wouldn&#39;t have ridden across the Ponte Sant&#39;Angelo with just me and the angels. </p>
    <p>I wouldn&#39;t have seen Rome in a new light&mdash; tranquil and serene; a city of peace and beauty&mdash; brooding, like a dark blue water color or an establishing shot to a moody detective flick. The spiraling labyrinth at the center of the city unwound for me at night, offering a glimpse at Rome more relaxed, as if to say: &quot;There is charm and beauty here. Relax and it will come to you, and even if you only see it for a moment, the whole thing will be worth it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="other">
        <h4>Two Other Things</h4>
        <p><strong>Pantheon</strong> The best preserved of building of the Roman world. I wouldn't even call it a ruin. Walking in will transport you back to ancient Rome.</p>
        <p><strong>Trastevere</strong> A slightly less touristy section of the city to find copious plates of pasta. In my opinion, it may be a bit overrated</p>
        <p><strong>Vatican Muesums</strong> A some what miserable experience but a must do. The sheer volume of artifacts, art, and tourists is astounding.</p>
