<h1 id="barchart-race">barchart-race</h1>
<p>I decided to try my hand at making one of the increasingly popular bar chart race plots. And since I
        work in government consulting, I of course decided to give it a government flavor. I give you
        budget outlays by year and department.</p>
<p>Let the race begin!</p>
<p><img src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/viz/final.gif')}}" alt="alt text"></p>
<p>So how does this work?</p>
<p>This is all done in R using this wonderful package called “gganimate”. Basically what this package
        lets you make gifs out of ggplots!</p>
<p>First lets start with the type of data that is needed for gganimate:</p>
<table class="table table-striped" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
        <thead>
                <tr>
                        <th>Time</th>
                        <th>Department</th>
                        <th>Budget</th>
                </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
                <tr>
                        <td>2018</td>
                        <td>DoD</td>
                        <td>105</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                        <td>2017</td>
                        <td>DoD</td>
                        <td>100</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                        <td>2018</td>
                        <td>SSA</td>
                        <td>55</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                        <td>2017</td>
                        <td>SSA</td>
                        <td>50</td>
                </tr>
        </tbody>
</table>
<p>How gganimate works is that the user to designate a variable as the “transition variable”. The
        packages then splits the plot data up into different states by the transition variable and
        animates transitions between those states. </p>
<p>So for this example, if you pick the “Time” variable, each frame in the gif will the source data
        filtered down to one year. The first frame will be a bar graph for just 2017, the second frame
        will be a bar graph for just 2018, and so on and on. Basically, you are creating hundreds of
        plots and showing one at a time to create a movie.</p>
<p>Here is what the above gif would look like if all the frames were shown at once:</p>
<p><img src="{{url_for('static', filename='images/viz/all-together.jpg')}}" alt=""></p>
<p>On top of cutting the plot data by time and showing them in sequence, gganimate also interpolates
        what should be between each plot. This allows you to create gifs with limited amount of data and
        smooths the animation between data points. As such, frames come in two flavors in gganimate:
        state and transitional. State frames are data points explicitly provided by the user.
        Transitional frames are interpolated data points between state frames. Using the above example,
        here is what is happening:</p>
<table class="table table-striped" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
        <thead>
                <tr>
                        <th>Time</th>
                        <th>Department</th>
                        <th>Budget</th>
                        <th>Frame Type</th>
                </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
                <tr>
                        <td>2018</td>
                        <td>DoD</td>
                        <td>105</td>

                <tr>
                        <td>2017.5</td>
                        <td>DoD</td>
                        <td>103</td>
                        <td>Transitional</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                        <td>2017</td>
                        <td>DoD</td>
                        <td>100</td>
                        <td>State</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                        <td>2018</td>
                        <td>SSA</td>
                        <td>55</td>
                        <td>State</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                        <td>2017.5</td>
                        <td>SSA</td>
                        <td>53</td>
                        <td>Transitional</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                        <td>2017</td>
                        <td>SSA</td>
                        <td>50</td>

                </tr>

<p>There would be three frames for this animation. Two state frames (2017 and 2018) and one transitional
        frame (2017.5). Realistically, there would be a lot more transitional frames between the two
        state frames to create a smooth animation. You can even specify the ratio between state frames
        and transition frames and how many frames the gif should be made up of! Playing around with
        these setting allows you to control how smooth the animation is and how long it “rests” on a
        state frame. </p>
<p>For my gif, I specified there should be 4 times as many transitional frames as state frames, 500
        frames overall, and it should run at 15 frames per second. More overall frames means more
        transition frames and thus better animations between states, but it also greatly increases the
        time to render. This animation took about 2 minutes to render—which was a real pain to debug. In
        fact, when I was debugging, I set the total frames to 10, so that I didn’t spend a ton of time
        looking at a loading screen when changing the plot around.</p>
<p>There is one more important concept to go over: object permanence. Like a new born baby, gganimate
        does not have object permanence built in. You need to be explicit about what objects in the plot
        can be animated. Lets say that you picked “Department” instead of “Time”, then gganimate would
        morph the value of SSA into DoD. </p>

<p>The values of 80 and 65 don’t really mean anything because the Department of Defense and the Social
        Security Administration are permanent objects. They cannot morph into each other—at least in the
        context of a sensible graphic. We need to be explicit about what objects can be animated and
        which cannot or else we will get some strange behavior in our gifs. Follow the link for
        gganimate for more info. </p>
<p>A lot went into making this plot, most of which is particular to this plot rather than something that
        most people would be interested in for their own animations. Check out the code for how this
        particular gif was made. Its well commented so it can serve as a bit of template for making
        things like this in the future—whether for clients or for fun! </p>
