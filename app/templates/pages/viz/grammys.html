<h1>Best New Artist</h1>
<p>How good is the Grammy&#39;s at predicting ~~<em>the future</em>~~? The answer is kind of good, but not great&mdash;Â at least when it comes to &quot;Best New Artist&quot;. I wanted to examine if the winner of best new artist had more staying power than the rest of their nominees. </p>
<p>My measure of &quot;staying power&quot;  would the number of followers on Spotify. I couldn&#39;t find album sales by artist, and monthly followers would be too erratic. Plus this was this data was relatively easy to get.</p>
<p>So what did I find?  Only for 18 of the 66 years that the Grammy&#39;s have been awarding &quot;Best New Artist&quot; did the Grammy&#39;s get it right. Some years were more wildly wrong than others (if you agree that followers on Spotify is a good measure who should be the best new artist).</p>
<p>Take 2011 for example. </p>

<p>In what world is Esperanza Spalding the best new artist in a year that includes: Justin Bieber, Drake, Florence and the Machine, and Mumford and Sons? At least by impact, Drake should have won.</p>
<p>See below for results for the 2000s:</p>

<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>First we need to get the data. Let&#39;s start with getting the best new artist for each year along with the nominees. We will be using <code>BeautifulSoup</code>:</p>
<pre><code class='language-python' lang='python'>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests 
import html5lib
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import time

# getting all the tables from wikipedia
URL = &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_New_Artist&quot;
r = requests.get(URL) 
sp = BeautifulSoup(r.content, &quot;lxml&quot;)  
tables = sp.find_all(&#39;table&#39;, {&quot;class&quot;: &quot;wikitable&quot;})

</code></pre>
<p>In order to unpack the results, we will be adding each nominee as a row to a data frame called <code>final</code>. Because they are in separate tables on wikipedia, we will have two loops&mdash; one that loops through each table, and one that loops through each row in each table.</p>
<pre><code class='language-python' lang='python'># final dataframe
final = pd.DataFrame() 

for table in tables:
  
  # turn into a normal dataframe and add a seperator
  df = pd.read_html(str(table).replace(&#39;&lt;/li&gt;&#39;,&#39;NOPE&#39;))[0]

  # for each dataframe, seperate each nominee into their own row
  for index, row in df.iterrows():

        # the three columns that will be in each row
        # split based on seperator
        nominees = row[&#39;Nominees&#39;].split(&quot;NOPE &quot;)
        year = np.tile(row[&quot;Year[I]&quot;], len(nominees)).tolist()
        winner = np.tile(&quot;No&quot;, len(nominees)).tolist()
        
        # this will be the new row
        temp = pd.DataFrame({
            &quot;nominees&quot;: nominees,
            &quot;year&quot;: year,
            &quot;winner&quot;: winner
          })
          
        # concating to final
        final = pd.concat([final, temp])
  
  # now we need to do the winners
  for index, row in df.iterrows():
        
        # now we do the same thing for the winners
        nominees = row[&#39;Recipient&#39;]
        year = row[&quot;Year[I]&quot;] 
        winner = [&quot;Yes&quot;]
        
        # this will be the new row
        temp = pd.DataFrame({
            &quot;nominees&quot;: nominees,
            &quot;year&quot;: year,
            &quot;winner&quot;: winner
          })
          
        # concating to final
        final = pd.concat([final, temp])

# getting rid of the NOPE      
final[&#39;nominees&#39;] = final[&#39;nominees&#39;].str.replace(&#39;NOPE&#39;,&#39;&#39;)
# dont include 2024
final = final[final[&#39;year&#39;] != 2024]
final

</code></pre>
<p>Next we need to get the number of followers per artist. We will hit the Spotify Search API and add it as a column:</p>
<pre><code class='language-python' lang='python'>#### ADDING TOKEN
# this will last for one hour

AUTH_URL = &#39;https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token&#39;

# POST
auth_response = requests.post(AUTH_URL, {
    &#39;grant_type&#39;: &#39;client_credentials&#39;,
    &#39;client_id&#39;: &quot;YOUR ID&quot;,
    &#39;client_secret&#39;: &quot;YOUR SECRET&quot;,
})

# convert the response to JSON
auth_response_data = auth_response.json()

# save the access token
access_token = auth_response_data[&#39;access_token&#39;]

headers = {
    &#39;Authorization&#39;: &#39;Bearer {token}&#39;.format(token=access_token)
}

#### CREATING LOOP
count = []

for index, row in final.iterrows():
  
  # too many requests and the loop doesnt work
  time.sleep(.7)
  print(index)
  artist = row[&quot;nominees&quot;]
  
  try:
    artist_search = &#39;https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=&#39; + artist + &#39;&amp;type=artist&amp;limit=1&#39;
    
    # actual GET request with proper header
    r = requests.get(artist_search, headers=headers)
    r = r.json()
    # this is the number of followers for the artist
    num = r[&quot;artists&quot;][&quot;items&quot;][0][&quot;followers&quot;][&quot;total&quot;]
    print(num)
    count.append(num)
  except:
    count.append(None)


# add the count as a new column
final[&quot;followers&quot;] = count

</code></pre>
<p>Once we finish that, we just need to add some new columns and rearrange the data. First we want to have two columns, one that has nominee with most followers per year and one that has the actual number of followers for that artist. Then we will filter down to those who won the grammy.</p>
<pre><code class='language-python' lang='python'># first we need to find the highest value of followers per group
final[&quot;highest&quot;] = final.groupby(&quot;year&quot;)[&quot;followers&quot;].transform(max)

# then we need find the difference in followers between the highest
# and the nominees
final[&quot;difference&quot;] = final[&quot;followers&quot;] - final[&quot;highest&quot;]

# next we are gonna create a score
# if the followers is the same as the highest, show the highest
# otherwise show the difference

# this is the value we are gonna graph
final[&quot;shoulda&quot;] = np.where(final[&quot;followers&quot;]==final[&quot;highest&quot;], 
    0, final[&quot;highest&quot;])

# next we need to know who had the highest for each year
highest = final[final[&quot;difference&quot;] == 0]
# we have to reset the index because py sucks
highest = highest.reset_index()
# we are gonn rename this to deserved and join it back to final
highest[&#39;deserved&#39;] = highest[&quot;nominees&quot;]
# less columns for the join
highest = highest[[&quot;year&quot;, &quot;deserved&quot;]]

# then we are to do a left join and fill it in with the value
merged = pd.merge(final, highest, on=&#39;year&#39;, how=&#39;left&#39;).fillna(method=&#39;ffill&#39;)

# and finally filter down to the winners
winners = merged[merged[&quot;winner&quot;] == &quot;Yes&quot;][[&quot;year&quot;, &quot;nominees&quot;, &quot;shoulda&quot;, &quot;followers&quot;, &quot;difference&quot;, &quot;deserved&quot;]]

</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we just need to make the graph:</p>
<pre><code class='language-python' lang='python'># next we are going to prepare the data for the graph
winners = winners[winners[&quot;year&quot;]&lt; 2024]

# adding the year after the winner and deserved
winners[&quot;winner&quot;] = winners[&quot;nominees&quot;] +  &quot; (&quot; + winners[&quot;year&quot;].astype(str) + &quot;)&quot;  
winners[&quot;deserved&quot;] = winners[&quot;deserved&quot;] +  &quot; (&quot; + winners[&quot;year&quot;].astype(str) + &quot;)&quot;   

# we will use this to add the labels
winners[&quot;offset&quot;] = 0

# we need a way to make the numbers in a human format
# i took this from stack overflow
# adding labels for difference
def human_format(num):
    if num &gt; 0:
        num = float(&#39;{:.3g}&#39;.format(num))
        magnitude = 0
        while abs(num) &gt;= 1000:
            magnitude += 1
            num /= 1000.0
        return &#39;{}{}&#39;.format(&#39;{:f}&#39;.format(num).rstrip(&#39;0&#39;).rstrip(&#39;.&#39;), [&#39;&#39;, &#39;K&#39;, &#39;M&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;T&#39;][magnitude])
    else:
        return &quot;&quot;

# now i need to apply it to the values in the variables    
out = []
for x in df[&quot;shoulda&quot;]:  
    out.append(human_format(abs(x)))
    
winners[&quot;shoulda_lab&quot;] = out

out = []
for x in df[&quot;followers&quot;]:  
    out.append(human_format(abs(x)))
    
winners[&quot;followers_lab&quot;] = out

# finally, we create the graph!
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

df2 = winners[winners[&quot;year&quot;]&gt;1999]

xaxis = df2[&quot;year&quot;]
x1 = df2[&quot;followers&quot;]
x2 = df2[&quot;shoulda&quot;]
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.bar_label(bottom, labels = df2[&quot;followers_lab&quot;], rotation=90)
ax.bar_label(top, labels = df2[&quot;shoulda_lab&quot;], rotation=90, padding = 5)

# in order for the artist names to be the same distance from each other
# we need to add padding from the same point, which in this case
# would be the offset variable set to 0
label_top = ax.bar(xaxis, df2[&quot;offset&quot;])
label_bottom = ax.bar(xaxis, df2[&quot;offset&quot;])

ax.bar_label(label_top, labels = df2[&quot;deserved&quot;], rotation=90, padding = 300)
